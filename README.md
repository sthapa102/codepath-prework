Background Color Changing IOS APP for CODEPATH-PREWORK

App Brainstorming

1) Instagram
    - Hiding text/ Disappearing text.
2)Twitter 
    -  Trending Hashtag Page. 
3) Reddit 
    -Sorting the posts by most viewed or most liked which makes it much easier to follow the news.
4) TikTok
    - For You Page which shows most that I would most interested in or show post from people I know but are not in my following list. 
5) Discord 
    - Staying on a call even though there are no people joined. 


Idea Of An App.

I live in New York City and it can be really hard to find a parking spot. I am sure there are apps that can already do this but I want to make an app where we take a map and mark where our car is parked. In the app I would like to implement voice navigation which lets us know where our car is parked and the distance of the parked spot. This app can also include features such as when two friends or more have to go to a destination, they can simply invite each other and start the journey together. The app then show their live GPS data of their location so that they can always see where the other one is.
